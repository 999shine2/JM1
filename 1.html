An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibody" target="_blank" title="anitobody definition">antibody</a>, also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a protein that is produced by <strong>plasma <u>cells</u> </strong> after stimulation by an antigen.<br><br>An antibody (Ab), also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig),[1] is a large, Y-shaped protein used by the immune system to identify and neutralize foreign objects such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses. The antibody recognizes a unique molecule of the pathogen, called an antigen.[2][3] Each tip of the "Y" of an antibody contains a paratope (analogous to a lock) <p style="margin-top:50px;">that is specific for one particular epitope (analogous to a key) on an antigen, allowing these two structures to bind together with precision. Using this binding mechanism, an antibody can tag a microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts of the immune system, or can neutralize it directly (for example, by blocking a part of a virus that is essential for its invasion).</p>
